# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

- Overview of Analysis

- This analysis was performed to investigate AutosRUs newest prototype the MechaCar. Which is suffering from delayed production. This data will be supplied to leadership with insights that will help.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- 1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

- 2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- 3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Study Design: MechaCar vs. Competition

- 1. What metric or metrics are you going to test?

- 2. What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

- 3. What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

- 4. What data is needed to run the statistical test?
